The Game folder was another version of the game while being under development, I left it there because it shows some process even though I restarted the project from scratch 

1 - The name of the game is Don't die to the pumpkin, it is a game
2 - The purpose of the game is to entertain people with my game, and at the same time I am using this project to learn more about game development
3 - By the end I hope I will have made a game, that I am proud of
4 - I used Godot 4 while writing with GDScript
